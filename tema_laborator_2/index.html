            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p><strong>Who is Steve Harris?</strong></p>
            <p>&emsp;Stephen Percy Harris (born 12 March 1956) is an English musician and songwriter, best known as the bassist, keyboardist, backing vocalist, primary songwriter, founder, and leader of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. He is the band's only constant member since their inception in 1975; along with guitarist Dave Murray, Harris is the only member to appear on every album.
                <br>&emsp;Initially Harris wanted to play drums, but did not have enough space for a drum kit in his house; he decided on learning bass instead. Entirely self-taught, is first bass was a copy of a Fender Precision model which cost him £40 in 1971.

            <h3>Artistry</h3>
            <p><strong>Unique technique and equipment</strong></p>
            <p>&emsp;Harris had been named among the best and most influential heavy metal bassists. He has a "galloping" playing style: usually an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes at fast tempo (e.g., "The Trooper" and "Run to the Hills") or eighth note triplets, which he plays with two fingers, rather than using a guitar pick.
                <br>&emsp;Harris's playing is often unusually prominent in the mix on Iron Maiden's recordings; he generally uses a tone with a treble-heavy EQ and compression to accentuate the attack on the strings. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that "Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it.
                <br>&emsp;Since Iron Maiden's beginning to the present day, Harris plays a specially-painted Fender Precision Bass, featured on every Iron Maiden album; the instrument has gone through a total of four colour changes since he began using it.
                <br>&emsp;In 2005, Metal Hammer reported that he uses eight 4x12" Marshall cabinets with Trace Elliot amplifiers. He also uses four Sony WRT 27 wireless transmitters, allowing him to be as mobile as possible on stage. His signal chain in 2000 also included a Trace Elliot preamp and a DBX compressor.
